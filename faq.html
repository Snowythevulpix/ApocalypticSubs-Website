            <h2>What motivated you to start fansubbing?</h2>
            <p>Our group started fansubbing The Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse as a
                <strong>NON PROFIT</strong> project, because there were none at the time of the release, no
                official
                subs, no
                fansubs. If nothing had changed, the fans wouldn't have any
                ways of watching it, while being able to understand anything that's being said.
                That is when we pull up to the stage, acting as some sort of middlemen between the anime and the
                community, providing translations and ways for people to watch it.

            <h2>Where can I watch the episodes?</h2>
            <p>
                There are currently two ways to watch our releases:<br>
                The first option is directly through our <a href="https://discord.gg/hXPgj7dvM7">Discord</a>.<br>
                Alternatively, you can download our releases using a torrent client.<br>
                Not sure what that is? Feel free to ask in our Discord â€” we're happy to help!

        <section>
            <h2>What do you think of other websites uploading your subs?</h2>
            <p>While we do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend watching through these means for lots of reasons
                (specially
                the security ones.) However we are not bothered by them taking our subs since we just want as
                many
                people to be able to enjoy it as possible.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>SuBs WeN?!</h2>
            <p>We don't give deadlines for the subs releases. This is a measure we took to avoid rushing the
                subs and
                delivering a bad product. We only ask you: please, don't be rude to the staff members. They're
                putting
                all their effort in their free time to fansub the episodes for you all. Not a fan of waiting?
                Complain
                to Netflix, not to us.</p>

            <p>Insert staff list and maybe comments? :P</p>
