00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.040
That's the biggest quake yet.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.100
And that rumbling is enough
to tear the Demon Realm apart!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.340
All we can do now
is put our faith in the Savior.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090
We're counting on you, Percival.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
The fate of the Demon Realm
rests on your shoulders.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200
I can't keep my footing!

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.550
Is this the Behemoth
our demon captives told us about?

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.200
The monster... Where is it?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.110
My eardrums are going to explode!

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.300
Percy?

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.120
Percy! What's wrong?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.460
What's wrong with him?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.120
I don't know, but something's off.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.130
Percy!

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.380
Percival! Come back to us!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.490
I'm a Life Spirit?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.360
Naw, no way! That's impossible.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.870
I lived with my grandpa for 16 years
on the Finger of God.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.160
I'm a human, and my name is Percival.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.620
Wrong.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.160
You merely inhabit this vessel
that is the human named Percival.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.170
Like these guys, we have no form,
and we have no individual identity.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.940
Your vessel would have known
it was a Spirit when it was a baby.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.180
But as you were raised
in the loving hands of a human,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.370
an emotion unknown to Spirits
began to well up inside of you.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.190
You came to believe you were human,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.790
and you forgot your Spirit ancestry.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.990
This is the truth.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.200
We are Life Spirits.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.970
We are a Piece of the Great One.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.700
You lie. This makes no sense at all!

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
I am human! I am the grandson
of the Holy Knight Varghese!

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.880
This is why I kept it from you.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.690
You never would have believed me.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.230
Not unless you heard it from Ironside,
who made you this way,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.680
or from someone who knew all the details.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.230
I'm scared... Help me...

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.830
I don't like it!

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.960
I'm scared! Bad things, go away!

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.580
Hey, what are they all so afraid of?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.260
They're afraid of what
you're all out here looking for.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.600
The door to Camelot.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.020
Please...

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.100
- Help us...
- Please...

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.890
Do they want me to help them?

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.270
But I wouldn't even know how to help them.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.270
No need to think about it.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.270
Just say what's in your heart.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.930
- I'm scared!
- I'm so scared!

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.070
Help us!

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.020
Don't be scared. It'll be all right.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020
- Please, no!
- I'm scared!

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.940
There's nothing scary out here.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.730
Nor will there be.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.080
We'll handle the door, one way or another.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.060
- There's nothing bad?
- Nothing bad?

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.210
- Nothing will happen?
- Won't happen?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.930
It's okay.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.050
It'll be okay.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.350
- It'll be okay.
- Okay.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.340
- Nothing will happen.
- It'll be okay.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.480
Looks like they've calmed down.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.350
So they heard me?

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.740
- We're not scared anymore.
- Thank you.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.690
- I feel happy.
- I'm sleepy.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.610
You gave them hope.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.770
Through hope, we bring life.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.130
And through despair, we bring death.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.050
I still don't believe
a word you're saying.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.390
I am Varghese's grandson. I am Percival.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.380
Believe what you like.
You'll see soon enough.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.640
You'll see why this "Percival" was born.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.660
Percy! Percival! Wake up!

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.390
The shaking and the rumbling...

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.400
It's all dying down?

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.670
Hey, you guys.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.420
The miasma's disappearing?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.670
Schwarz.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.260
This is Master Percival's doing.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.420
So Ironside was right.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.570
Hey, why is everyone...

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.610
Percival! We were so worried.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.280
You've regained consciousness.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.820
Are you all right?

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.200
Yeah.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.210
Hey, it's going to be all right now.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.750
Behemoth has gone back to sleep.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.450
It's asleep?

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.170
Is that why the quaking
and the miasma's gone away?

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.450
But how? And when?

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.510
Well, you see... Behemoth was calling to me.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.460
You mean while you were in that trance?

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.460
I... think so.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.470
So what happened?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.560
Well!

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.520
All I did was talk to the Life Spirits
that were living inside Behemoth.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.470
What?

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.900
You spoke with Life Spirits?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.480
Impossible! Life Spirits
are the highest form of Spirits out there.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.240
As if a pleb like you--

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.160
Percival, are you sure you're all right?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.740
Anne...

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.800
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.880
Well, that's good then.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.390
Yeah.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.500
Hey Anne, what's up?

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.140
Everyone, look!

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.760
Look at that!

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.940
That's... the door, isn't it?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.280
Doesn't look anything
like the one our brand makes.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.530
There is no doubt.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.530
Camelot is that way.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.530
- Everyone! Let us hurry!
- Right!

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.530
Wait! We've got to get Gawain back.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.710
- Of course.
- Let's do it.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.640
I'll help too.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.540
You need to run!

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.140
You're not going anywhere.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.110
Sword Draw: Ruthless Highwind.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.710
Can you perceive my Sword Draw?

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.210
Lancelot!

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.240
To see through and deflect a Sword Draw...

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.170
It's a miracle.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.050
So much more monstrous than the rumors.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.590
Was he trying to kill us with the door?

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.320
If it weren't for Lancelot...

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.860
The door!

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.380
The door's still there.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.610
I cannot allow you to go any further.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.870
Your defeat here and now
has been prophesied.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.850
Hey, it's him.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.390
Yeah.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.900
He's the one who escaped
with Ironside at Sistana.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.110
The one to deliver your coup de grâce

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.940
should really be Ironside instead of me.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.250
However, I hereby accept this task.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.130
Percival, O Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.660
I challenge you to a duel!

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.670
Percival, O Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.020
I challenge you to a duel!

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.680
You want to battle with me?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.680
Yes, Percival. If you are
a Knight of Prophecy, you will accept,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.200
Percival!

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.940
Don't do it.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.690
- What's with her?
- Why is the enemy...

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.670
Rosebank. What are you doing?

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.610
Sir Mortlach.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.700
Must it all end in bloodshed?

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.380
Percival saw me as the enemy,
and still he came to my aid.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.960
Can we not just talk this out?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.710
Remember your vows.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.680
We each swore an oath
to protect what is precious to us

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.700
by destroying the Knights of Prophecy
who are set to destroy Camelot.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.720
I...

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.720
I understand.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.330
I accept your challenge.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.030
Good answer.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.760
This is bad.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.830
Percival, here!

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.440
That's...

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.260
the Percival Sword.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.630
Why are you giving this to me?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.260
Rosebank! How dare you?

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.150
They disappeared.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.770
Where did they go?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.800
Where am I?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.390
This is where we duel.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.560
You and me.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.780
What's that?

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.330
The monuments behind us

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.330
are a symbol of the burdens we bear.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.250
Whenever somebody accepts my duel,
they are summoned to this arena.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.090
That is my power.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.080
Duelist.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.500
Rule number one.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.840
The only way to leave is to be killed
or be otherwise incapacitated.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.600
It's one or the other!

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.850
Rule number two.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.980
No magic allowed during the duel.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.110
The only thing you may rely on
is pure brute strength.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.280
Percival. I know everything about you.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.880
I know what you really are,
and why you were born.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.490
You'll see soon enough.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.300
You'll see why this "Percival" was born.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.380
That is why.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.150
I will end you before you become
even more of a nuisance.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.530
Then I will make you tell me
everything you know.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.890
You bastards! What did you do to Percival?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.890
We failed him.
He was right there in front of us!

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.560
You! Humans! You'll pay for this!

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.250
As much as you'll be paying too.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.670
O Chaos. Show us the strength
that is the origin of all creation.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.550
I offer you the promised six.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.440
This is...

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.930
Whoa!

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.770
Nice catch.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.580
What just happened?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.940
This is bad.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.840
I'm not normally one to fight with humans.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.070
But it's too late now.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.230
Now, show me the power
granted to you by Chaos...

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.620
Testament Beast!

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.640
Perfect. Armor is only
a hindrance for you.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.190
So you are Lancelot,
the one who bested my master.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.770
I knew it the minute
you dodged my Sword Draw.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.270
You're not even trying here.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.470
You really are something else.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.020
I could say the same of you.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.010
So? What's your name?

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.030
Some call me Tomintoul.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.050
I abandoned my real name
along with my former master.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.470
You may call me Nanashi.
That's what suits me best.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.680
Looks like I'll have some fun with you.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.420
I am Nanashi, sword instructor
to my master, King Arthur.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.050
Now, let us begin!

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.940
It seems Mortlach and his group

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.450
have begun their battle
with the Four Knights of the Apocalypse.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:10.070
Even better, Percival has been dragged
into Mortlach's dueling arena.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.730
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.760
With one less Knight of the Apocalypse,
the prophecy is sure to fail.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:25.080
Magic is not permitted
within the confines of the Duelist arena.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.020
The only thing you may rely on
is pure brute strength.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.720
My brother-in-law
is a far greater swordsman than I.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.570
Percival. You are destined
to meet your end there.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:42.560
We met once before,
but I never did say my name.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.390
It's Mortlach.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.440
Mortlach. Can I ask you something?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.290
Sure.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:56.800
You said the monuments behind us
are a symbol of the burdens we bear.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.830
Who is that behind you?

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.120
Does he know what you
and your friends are doing?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.940
Does he know King Arthur orders you
to take the homes of those in Britannia?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.020
Does he know the pain
you've caused to all the races?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.610
When I was but a boy,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.210
my sister was five years older than me,
and I was always by her side.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.320
Our mother died at an early age.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.150
This drove our father to drinking,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.410
and he was a mean drunk.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.470
My sister looked out for me,
and raised me in place of our parents.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.170
A few years later, she got married.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.170
She married Ironside, and bore his child.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.680
Dad had a child? That means...

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.550
But then the Holy War shattered
what should have been a joyous occasion.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:05.180
She was poisoned by the rotting flesh
that fell from the Demon King.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.000
Ironside tried everything to cure her.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.330
But she died.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.070
This is Diodora, her orphaned son.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.330
He is my one and only shining light.
He is who I risk my life to protect.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.910
Diodora... is my brother?

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.930
But he too was poisoned
while still in the womb.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.210
His time was running out.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.100
The only reason he is still with us today

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.980
is because of Camelot's divine protection.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.910
Do you understand?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.230
You're the ones who want to take from us!

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.950
You would take the only place
Diodora can live!

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.900
You would take his life!

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.240
You have no right
to take it all away from him.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.620
I understand how you feel.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.250
But we definitely have to stop
King Arthur and my father.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.640
But most importantly, I have my friends.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.370
I cannot lose. For their sake!

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.820
Which means we are left with no choice
but to fight!

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:42.800
Then I will fight for my friends,
even if it costs me my life!

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.350
BANQUET FOR BRAVES

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:28.320
