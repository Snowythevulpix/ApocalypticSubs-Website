WEBVTT

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.944
That's the biggest quake yet.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:54.697
And that rumbling is enough
to tear the Demon Realm apart!

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.911
All we can do now
is put our faith in the Savior.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.583
We're counting on you, Percival.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:09.796
The fate of the Demon Realm
rests on your shoulders.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.801
I can't keep my footing!

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.098
Is this the Behemoth
our demon captives told us about?

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.101
The monster... Where is it?

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.104
My eardrums are going to explode!

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.898
Percy?

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.235
Percy! What's wrong?

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.361
What's wrong with him?

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.947
I don't know, but something's off.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.031
Percy!

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.868
Percival! Come back to us!

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.093
I'm a Life Spirit?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.891
Naw, no way! That's impossible.

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:07.770
I lived with my grandpa for 16 years
on the Finger of God.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.398
I'm a human, and my name is Percival.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.524
Wrong.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.904
You merely inhabit this vessel
that is the human named Percival.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.912
Like these guys, we have no form,
and we have no individual identity.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:29.542
Your vessel would have known
it was a Spirit when it was a baby.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:34.339
<i>But as you were raised
in the loving hands of a human,</i>

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:38.968
<i>an emotion unknown to Spirits
began to well up inside of you.</i>

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.432
<i>You came to believe you were human,</i>

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.393
<i>and you forgot your Spirit ancestry.</i>

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.522
This is the truth.

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.983
We are Life Spirits.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.569
We are a Piece of the Great One.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.199
You lie. This makes no sense at all!

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:05.203
I am human! I am the grandson
of the Holy Knight Varghese!

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.300
This is why I kept it from you.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.220
You never would have believed me.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.224
Not unless you heard it from Ironside,
who made you this way,

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:30.103
or from someone who knew all the details.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.648
<i>I'm scared... Help me...</i>

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.733
<i>I don't like it!</i>

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.486
<i>I'm scared! Bad things, go away!</i>

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.032
Hey, what are they all so afraid of?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.204
They're afraid of what
you're all out here looking for.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.497
The door to Camelot.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.915
<i>Please...</i>

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.001
- <i>Help us...</i>
- <i>Please...</i>

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.420
Do they want me to help them?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.008
But I wouldn't even know how to help them.

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:01.968
No need to think about it.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.178
Just say what's in your heart.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.529
- <i>I'm scared!</i>
- <i>I'm so scared!</i>

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.665
<i>Help us!</i>

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.921
Don't be scared. It'll be all right.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.924
- <i>Please, no!</i>
- <i>I'm scared!</i>

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.844
There's nothing scary out here.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.179
Nor will there be.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.682
We'll handle the door, one way or another.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.436
- <i>There's nothing bad?</i>
- <i>Nothing bad?</i>

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.814
- <i>Nothing will happen?</i>
- <i>Won't happen?</i>

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.528
It's okay.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.948
It'll be okay.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.951
<i>- It'll be okay.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.040
<i>- Nothing will happen.</i>
- <i>It'll be okay.</i>

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.005
Looks like they've calmed down.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.966
So they heard me?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.636
- <i>We're not scared anymore.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.138
<i>- I feel happy.
- I'm sleepy.</i>

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.308
You gave them hope.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:38.147
Through hope, we bring life.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.734
And through despair, we bring death.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.947
I still don't believe
a word you're saying.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.991
I am Varghese's grandson. I am Percival.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:54.205
Believe what you like.
You'll see soon enough.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.128
You'll see why this "Percival" was born.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:08.261
Percy! Percival! Wake up!

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.931
The shaking and the rumbling...

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.850
It's all dying down?

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.273
Hey, you guys.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:27.947
The miasma's disappearing?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.366
Schwarz.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.161
This is Master Percival's doing.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:36.164
So Ironside was right.

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.169
Hey, why is everyone...

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.506
Percival! We were so worried.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.175
You've regained consciousness.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.718
Are you all right?

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.802
Yeah.

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.806
Hey, it's going to be all right now.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.351
Behemoth has gone back to sleep.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.021
It's asleep?

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:03.065
Is that why the quaking
and the miasma's gone away?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.694
But how? And when?

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:11.407
Well, you see... Behemoth was calling to me.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.868
You mean while you were in that trance?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.329
I... think so.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.997
So what happened?

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.459
Well!

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:25.421
All I did was talk to the Life Spirits
that were living inside Behemoth.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.631
What?

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:29.800
You spoke with Life Spirits?

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:36.265
Impossible! Life Spirits
are the highest form of Spirits out there.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.142
As if a pleb like you--

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.062
Percival, are you sure you're all right?

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:42.146
Anne...

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.399
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.779
Well, that's good then.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:50.988
Yeah.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.283
Hey Anne, what's up?

00:08:56.994 --> 00:08:59.038
Everyone, look!

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:00.456
Look at that!

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.843
That's... the door, isn't it?

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.180
Doesn't look anything
like the one our brand makes.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.932
There is no doubt.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.434
Camelot is that way.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.311
- Everyone! Let us hurry!
- Right!

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:26.357
Wait! We've got to get Gawain back.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.610
- Of course.
- Let's do it.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.237
I'll help too.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.992
You need to run!

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:38.744
You're not going anywhere.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.709
<i>Sword Draw: Ruthless Highwind.</i>

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.305
Can you perceive my Sword Draw?

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.811
Lancelot!

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.734
To see through and deflect a Sword Draw...

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.069
It's a miracle.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.946
So much more monstrous than the rumors.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.409
Was he trying to kill us with the door?

00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:20.703
If it weren't for Lancelot...

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.455
The door!

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.975
The door's still there.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.604
I cannot allow you to go any further.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.360
Your defeat here and now
has been prophesied.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.198
Hey, it's him.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.991
Yeah.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:04.497
<i>He's the one who escaped
with Ironside at Sistana.</i>

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.008
The one to deliver your coup de grâce

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.470
should really be Ironside instead of me.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.849
However, I hereby accept this task.

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:30.564
Percival, O Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:34.235
I challenge you to a duel!

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.414
Percival, O Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.917
I challenge you to a duel!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.294
You want to battle with me?

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:56.507
Yes, Percival. If you are
a Knight of Prophecy, you will accept,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.800
Percival!

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:00.511
Don't do it.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.014
- What's with her?
- Why is the enemy...

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:07.017
Rosebank. What are you doing?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.103
Sir Mortlach.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.440
Must it all end in bloodshed?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.278
Percival saw me as the enemy,
and still he came to my aid.

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:20.781
Can we not just talk this out?

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.616
Remember your vows.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.578
We each swore an oath
to protect what is precious to us

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:30.166
by destroying the Knights of Prophecy
who are set to destroy Camelot.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.168
I...

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:36.672
I understand.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:40.926
I accept your challenge.

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:43.929
Good answer.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.139
This is bad.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.433
Percival, here!

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.937
That's...

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.856
the Percival Sword.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.234
Why are you giving this to me?

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.863
Rosebank! How dare you?

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.052
They disappeared.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.845
Where did they go?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:48.661
Where am I?

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:49.912
This is where we duel.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.164
You and me.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.380
What's that?

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.927
The monuments behind us

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.931
are a symbol of the burdens we bear.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:15.145
Whenever somebody accepts my duel,
they are summoned to this arena.

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.689
That is my power.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.732
Duelist.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.028
Rule number one.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:28.200
The only way to leave is to be killed
or be otherwise incapacitated.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.202
It's one or the other!

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.048
Rule number two.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.509
No magic allowed during the duel.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.679
The only thing you may rely on
is pure brute strength.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.183
Percival. I know everything about you.

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:56.478
I know what you really are,
and why you were born.

00:14:58.105 --> 00:14:59.940
You'll see soon enough.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.903
You'll see why this "Percival" was born.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.282
That is why.

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:12.745
I will end you before you become
even more of a nuisance.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:18.125
Then I will make you tell me
everything you know.

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.713
You bastards! What did you do to Percival?

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:26.759
We failed him.
He was right there in front of us!

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.012
You! Humans! You'll pay for this!

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:33.849
As much as you'll be paying too.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:41.565
O Chaos. Show us the strength
that is the origin of all creation.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:45.152
I offer you the promised six.

00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:54.036
This is...

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.672
Whoa!

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.299
Nice catch.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.176
What just happened?

00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:14.390
This is bad.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:45.337
I'm not normally one to fight with humans.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.673
But it's too late now.

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:53.012
Now, show me the power
granted to you by Chaos...

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.223
Testament Beast!

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:21.540
Perfect. Armor is only
a hindrance for you.

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:25.711
So you are Lancelot,
the one who bested my master.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:29.298
I knew it the minute
you dodged my Sword Draw.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.093
You're not even trying here.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.928
You really are something else.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:36.764
I could say the same of you.

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.433
So? What's your name?

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:42.895
Some call me Tomintoul.

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.648
I abandoned my real name
along with my former master.

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:54.073
You may call me Nanashi.
That's what suits me best.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:58.577
Looks like I'll have some fun with you.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.915
I am Nanashi, sword instructor
to my master, King Arthur.

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.084
Now, let us begin!

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.840
It seems Mortlach and his group

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:16.345
have begun their battle
with the Four Knights of the Apocalypse.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:21.600
Even better, Percival has been dragged
into Mortlach's dueling arena.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.228
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:30.359
With one less Knight of the Apocalypse,
the prophecy is sure to fail.

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:36.657
Magic is not permitted
within the confines of the Duelist arena.

00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:39.618
The only thing you may rely on
is pure brute strength.

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:44.623
<i>My brother-in-law
is a far greater swordsman than I.</i>

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:49.128
<i>Percival. You are destined
to meet your end there.</i>

00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:54.091
We met once before,
but I never did say my name.

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:55.884
It's Mortlach.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.888
Mortlach. Can I ask you something?

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:01.640
Sure.

00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:08.147
You said the monuments behind us
are a symbol of the burdens we bear.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.357
Who is that behind you?

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:15.028
Does he know what you
and your friends are doing?

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:21.535
Does he know King Arthur orders you
to take the homes of those in Britannia?

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.622
Does he know the pain
you've caused to all the races?

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.510
When I was but a boy,

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.555
<i>my sister was five years older than me,
and I was always by her side.</i>

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.224
<i>Our mother died at an early age.</i>

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.186
<i>This drove our father to drinking,</i>

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.188
<i>and he was a mean drunk.</i>

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:54.067
<i>My sister looked out for me,
and raised me in place of our parents.</i>

00:19:57.404 --> 00:20:00.073
<i>A few years later, she got married.</i>

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.576
<i>She married Ironside, and bore his child.</i>

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.580
Dad had a child? That means...

00:20:06.663 --> 00:20:11.043
<i>But then the Holy War shattered
what should have been a joyous occasion.</i>

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:16.965
<i>She was poisoned by the rotting flesh
that fell from the Demon King.</i>

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:21.595
<i>Ironside tried everything to cure her.</i>

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.933
<i>But she died.</i>

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:31.521
This is Diodora, her orphaned son.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:35.859
He is my one and only shining light.
He is who I risk my life to protect.

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.404
<i>Diodora... is my brother?</i>

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:44.826
But he too was poisoned
while still in the womb.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.870
His time was running out.

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.000
The only reason he is still with us today

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.878
is because of Camelot's divine protection.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:57.506
Do you understand?

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.974
You're the ones who want to take from us!

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.851
You would take the only place
Diodora can live!

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.395
You would take his life!

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.065
You have no right
to take it all away from him.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:21.154
I understand how you feel.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:26.910
But we definitely have to stop
King Arthur and my father.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.540
But most importantly, I have my friends.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.750
I cannot lose. For their sake!

00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:39.423
Which means we are left with no choice
but to fight!

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:54.396
Then I will fight for my friends,
even if it costs me my life!

00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:09.953
BANQUET FOR BRAVES
