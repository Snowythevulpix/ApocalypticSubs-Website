THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS:
FOUR KNIGHTS OF THE APOCALYPSE

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:47.440 line:20%
THE BOY OF DESTINY

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:53.196
Did something happen with Tristan?

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.865
He's been acting funny
ever since yesterday.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.033
Who knows.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:02.747
<i>What happened with Tristan yesterday
is our little secret, after all.</i>

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.625
What's going on?

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.671
The spirits?

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.925
Don't just jump out like that.
I haven't summoned you.

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.678
Looks like they're trembling.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.143 line:20%
Did something frighten them?

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.688
Zarura N'Du?

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:30.233
"We are a Piece of the Great One"?

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.902
Ring any bells?

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.823
Well, how about this?

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.117
<i>Vas Zigra!</i> "Awaken!"

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:41.536
Well?

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.037 line:20%
What?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.542 line:20%
No good?
Guess you've been out for too long.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:51.838 line:20%
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:54.674 line:20%
Hey. We're not done training yet.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.386
Level two, clear.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.930
Next up is level three.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.767
You just leave that with me again.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.935
Hey, wait!

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.452
Wow, pretty powerful.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.082 line:20%
We're gonna have some fun with this one!

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.337 line:20%
Don't tell me level three is...

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.465
Pellegarde?

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.385 line:20%
Don't mind that Pellegarde.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.348 line:20%
He's the one who awakened
Percival for us, after all.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:49.270
Damn, seriously?
Crossing swords at Pellegarde's level?

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.405
I'm not falling for that again!

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.367
- Missed again!
- No!

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.705
That's a point!

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.666
He won again.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.376
No way!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.173
Still, that was only the Pellegarde
you calculated from Percival's memories.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.761
I doubt he's ever used
his full strength against Percival.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.888
At best, it was only half.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.892
And of course,
I'm not using my full reserves either.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.730
Level three, clear.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.774
Not half bad.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.904
Level four starts now.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.660
As much as I'd love to be all "Bring it!"

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.497
this is Percival's training, right?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.708
I won't butt in any more.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.669
I've had my fill of teasing you.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:05:00.550
Seems the one from this level is
the one Percival's gotta fight on his own.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.179
The one I have to fight on my own?

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:09.183 line:20%
I know this presence! It's...

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.687
Ironside.

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.733
He's going to fight Ironside
all on his own?

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:20.153
Against someone
not even us four could take?

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:26.701 line:20%
I'm much stronger than I was back then.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.329 line:20%
<i>I must be on par with him now.</i>

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.456 line:20%
<i>Or at least pretty close...</i>

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.710 line:20%
<i>Or I can give at least
a bit of a fight, maybe?</i>

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.214
Can I help him out one last time?

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.385 line:20%
Going back on your word already?

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.804 line:20%
Absolutely no manners whatsoever.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.392
Have it your way.
Two versus one is fine by me.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:55.938
Don't get me wrong.
Percival's gonna do all the fighting.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.953
Wow.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:14.165
I feel the magic seeping into my body.

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.918
My limbs... My fingers and toes...

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:21.923
It's like I can feel through
every finger, every strand of hair!

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:27.804
<i>Every nerve in your body
has been heightened.</i>

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:29.889
<i>Here he comes.</i>

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:34.936 line:20%
Now it's my turn!

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.689
He can't dodge that!

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.528
I can't dodge an attack...

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.531
like that?

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.368
Did you see that?

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.538
His timing was impeccable,
and that jump was superb.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.833
Was that you just now?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.461
<i>I didn't do anything. That was all you.</i>

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.421
That was me?

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.633
<i>But you gotta learn
how to control your power.</i>

00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:09.303
<i>You'd be falling headfirst
if we were on a narrow edge.</i>

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:15.518 line:20%
Do you see now just how much power
you've had untapped within you?

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.603 line:20%
Listen here.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:22.024 line:20%
You need to learn and master
how every part of your body moves,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.820 line:20%
at what timing,
and with how much strength.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.823
Why are you doing all this for me?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.660
<i>It's simple.</i>

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.370
<i>Because it is your duty...</i>

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.250
<i>to bring Ironside to justice.</i>

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.601
The miasma of death!

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.020
Behemoth's negative energy
is closing in on us!

00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:01.022
Seek shelter, quickly!

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:03.399
Hey, everyone! Look over there!

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:17.663
The rain of fire's stopped.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.666
The path to Behemoth is about to open.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.670
Master Percival
will save the Demon Realm again!

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.672
Do not lose hope!

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:39.060
I'm afraid we must
count on you once again, Percival.

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:44.190
Not sure I'll be much help,
but I'd like to try.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:47.193
Does this mean he passed his training?

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:50.530
Nope. His opponent was too strong.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.156 line:20%
- How about you, Donny?
- Don't even ask.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.199 line:20%
Really?

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:58.204
Come back to the Demon Realm anytime,
my bouncing baby boy.

00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.539
Gel.

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.749
Gelda's right.

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:04.627
You're not just the savior
of the Demon Realm.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.463
You're also like our beloved son.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.426
I've arranged transport
for you to get to Behemoth.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.304
Take care.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.975
Thank you.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.893
Percy. Let's go.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.603
Sure.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.327
It's moving! This thing is moving!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.246
And it's ginormous.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.290
It's like a mountain!

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:46.252
And it's fast! This Alpion!

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:48.879 line:20%
The Great Beasts, "Albion."

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.008 line:20%
They're the golems used in the Holy War.

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:55.761 line:20%
Who'd have thought you could
climb inside and control them?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.180
Hey! Why do you get to drive it?

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.349 line:20%
Whoo-hoo! I want a turn too!

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.728
You'll get your turn.
Let me handle it for now.

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.522
Well, I'm glad everyone's having fun.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:11.527
But didn't they say we could set it
so it would take us there automatically?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.406
Do you not have a man brain, Nasiens?

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.867
See? Lancelot gets it.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.119
A man brain?

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.621 line:20%
More like a kid's brain.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:27.126
Hey, you do realize
Gawain never came back, right?

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.419
She's right.

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:31.005
Maybe we should have waited for her?

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.882 line:20%
She's probably dead.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.385
Hey, that's no way to talk about a friend.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.055 line:20%
There's no point
in worrying about that now.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.432 line:20%
Our mission is simple.

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.851 line:20%
Find the door to Camelot and enter.

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.187 line:20%
And kill all who stand in our way.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.191 line:20%
Gawain is a Knight of Prophecy.
She'll be back.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:53.277
That's just wishful thinking.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.322
You really think things work out
just like they do in stories?

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.199
Chion. Stop it.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.203
Whatever happens,
we've got no choice in the matter.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.207 line:20%
Because that is our destiny.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:10.711 line:20%
Lancelot! Look out!

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.717
It's getting harder to see.
Behemoth must be close by.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.302
But hang on.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.679
Doesn't the miasma seem to be avoiding us?

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.932
Maybe it's a feature of the Albion?

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.236
Why does the miasma
have no effect on this area only?

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:38.739
It matters not,
for it works out well for us.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.159
Not even I can protect us from the miasma.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.246
Either way,
we'll keep our presence hidden.

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:50.126
Our goal is to destroy the door
and prevent them from entering.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:53.629
And to get rid of Percival.

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:57.800
Our mission begins once we reach Behemoth.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.911
Hey, I wonder where Behemoth is?

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:28.414
We've traveled pretty far.

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:32.793
It's pretty big,
so we should be seeing it soon, I hope.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.674
No need to search.
We're already on Behemoth's back.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:39.675
What?

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.428
You've been here before, you know?

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.722
Have I really, Jiggly-me?

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.808
Don't call me that.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:53.189
Compared to Behemoth,
this Albion is the size of a flea.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:57.401
So we could find the door any moment now?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:01.447
But we'll never find it
with the miasma so thick.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.241
You noticed that too?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.285
Seems we have some flies on our head.

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.204
I'm gonna shake us.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.007
- Watch out, Tristan!
- Thank you.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.510 line:20%
Looks like we've got company.

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.309
How did they know?

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:32.978
I was sure our presence was hidden.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.689
They focused too much
on hiding their presence

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:37.858
and let their thoughts
leak out completely.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.485
There are six or seven of them.

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.737
We are left with no choice.

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:45.074
Arakdo! Destroy the Albion!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:48.994
What is that?

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.497
One of their purgatorial beasts.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.875
Not bad! A perfect match for the Albion!

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.002
Why are you so happy about this?

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.472
That thing's faster than the Albion.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.766
Doesn't this thing
have any anti-air defenses?

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.979
Fire! Shoot it down!

00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:19.066 line:20%
- Damn it.
- <i>Zoa!</i>

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.993 line:20%
- It fired!
- Good job, Percy!

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:31.245 line:20%
You keep firing at it.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:33.455 line:20%
<i>Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!</i>

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:36.166
<i>Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!</i>

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:39.336
I think you overdid it!

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.713 line:20%
What do I do?

00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:43.340
Wow. This is so much fun.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.718
Lance! Back to reality!

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.052
What Tristan said!

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:51.307
How monstrously destructive!

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.977
I think we're done for, Sir Mortlach.

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.027
It hit the Albion.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.486
We're not done for yet.

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.990
Nice toy you got there.

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:12.912
But it's no match for Arakdo,
the mystical beast from Purgatory.

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:16.749
I sense their presence in its abdomen.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.876
Aim for the belly and--

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:26.926
No way.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.470
Stomach Ray.

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:33.015
No enemy can survive
the Albion's killer move.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.184
That was just your bow and arrow!

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.686
But hot damn, what a bow and arrow!

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:41.190
What are you talking about?

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.525
That was the Albion's killer move.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.027
My mistake.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.864
Seems he can't stand the idea
of the Albion losing.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.033
I told you. Kid brain.

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:53.452
<i>Help, I'm scared.</i>

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.413
Hey, is someone trying to say something?

00:15:58.165 --> 00:15:59.500
The Albion is falling.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.889
The Albion stopped moving.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.725
Are you sure it's okay to get out of it?

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.687
Yes, the miasma is still avoiding us.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.772
Wonder why it's doing that?

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.857
Is it you, Tristan?

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.985
Not even the power of the Goddess Clan

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.821
can protect against
such powerful negative energy.

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:29.989
Really?

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:33.325
This is Percival's magic.

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:36.286
This is my doing?

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.080
No way.

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:42.292
So this is why my uncle said
we'd be all right as long as he's with us.

00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:48.090
Who exactly are you?

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:51.510
Well, I don't really know either.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.554
I bet you know though, right?

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.556
Before we get to that,

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:59.435
how about we take out
those dogs that have been sniffing around?

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:07.192
It was Percival
keeping the miasma at bay all along?

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:12.281
Are you sure he's the weakest
of the Knights of Prophecy?

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.784
I must say, we are severely disadvantaged.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.247
Saint Coat.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.540
SAINT COAT

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.543
Is that Goddess magic?

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:27.171
Why would there be a Goddess
among the Knights of Chaos?

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.342
The negative energy is too strong.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:34.428
We're in the heart of the miasma.

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:36.013
Are we going to die?

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.931
We haven't even completed our mission.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:41.351
King Arthur, please forgive us.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.437
Don't give up!

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:48.192
Looks like we have to roll the dice.

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:58.202 line:20%
Gawain!

00:17:58.285 --> 00:18:00.287
So she fell into the hands of the enemy.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.123
We have brought shame to ourselves!

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:08.045
To think someone from the Goddess Clan
was walking among the humans.

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:11.173
And he is incredibly skilled.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.972
What will you do,
O Knights of the Apocalypse?

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.893
Your precious friends will die
if you don't come on down here.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.356
Don't listen to him.

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.317
It's my own fault
for charging ahead on my own.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.905
Stay right where you are
and bear witness to our deaths.

00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:38.325
I take full responsibility
for my own failure.

00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:42.329
My lady, you plan to go down with us?

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:45.874
You are mistaken, Mortlach.

00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:50.671
They are not my friends, nor my comrades.

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.339
To them, I am just a stranger.

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:56.927
Let's go!

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.680
Man, we always end up doing this!

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:02.057
- Percival!
- Tristan!

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.684
Why?

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.572
Looks like the gamble paid off.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.951 line:20%
Why would you make things harder
for yourselves for a stranger like me?

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.327 line:20%
You fools!

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.873
Everyone starts out as strangers at first.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:30.085
But you go through hardships together
and you end up becoming friends.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:33.839
Gawain. You're a good friend to us now.

00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:35.674
Please don't make my efforts

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:39.219
to convince you
to come along with us be in vain.

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.972
I still owe you a pudding.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.226 line:20%
You're so naive.
Each and every one of you.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.353
And you over there.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:51.315
I went to the trouble of saving you,
so I can't just watch you die.

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:53.483
And you have something of mine to return.

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.277
Percival?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.906
He saved you? Is this true?

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.949
Explain yourself, Rosebank!

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.167
Percival, Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.461
You may be our enemy,
but you are an admirable young man.

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.462
However...

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.466
We too have something we cannot concede.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.468
We too have something to protect.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:23.222
And for that,
we can let you go no further,

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.225
even if it means resorting
to dishonorable means.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:27.309
<i>Help...</i>

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.229
<i>There's that strange voice again.</i>

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.563
<i>Help.</i>

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.857
<i>Help us!</i>

00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:35.442
Where am I?

00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:40.197
Lancelot? Donny? Anne? Nasiens?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.490
Where is everyone?

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:42.658
<i>Help us!</i>

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.494
<i>Go away, bad things. I'm scared.</i>

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.205
This is our world.

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.623
Jiggly-me?

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:52.876
You were summoned by these voices.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.256
You were resonating with the voices,
and so you got pulled over to this side.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.466
Who's calling out to me?

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:03.136
Is it the same people
I've been hearing for a while now?

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.888
They're over there.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:07.474 line:20%
<i>Help us.</i>

00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:10.143 line:20%
- What's this blob?
- <i>Bad things, go away!</i>

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:13.855 line:20%
It's afraid of the unusual events
taking place in the Demon Realm.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:17.276 line:20%
This is the true form of
the gigantic beast they call "Behemoth."

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.695 line:20%
This is Behemoth?

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:23.740
It is also our sibling.

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:26.743
I don't understand.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:30.789
You mean to say you and me
are related to this thing?

00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:32.666 line:20%
Listen carefully.

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:36.461 line:20%
You and I, we have no form,
and we have no individual identity.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.049 line:20%
We are beings who bring
prosperity and death to all the realms.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.969
What are you?

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.596
What am I?

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:50.017
We are Life Spirits.

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.399 line:20%
Life Spirits?

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:58.567
Yes.

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:09.995
Humans, demons,
goddesses, giants, fairies.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:12.831
We are the source

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.667
that sustains all life in this world.

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:18.378
That is what resides within Behemoth.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:20.964
That is what I am. And what you are.

00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.141
BANQUET FOR BRAVES
