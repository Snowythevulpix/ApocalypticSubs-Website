WEBVTT

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.100
THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS:
FOUR KNIGHTS OF THE APOCALYPSE

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.440
THE BOY OF DESTINY

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.200
Did something happen with Tristan?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.870
He's been acting funny
ever since yesterday.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.030
Who knows.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.750
What happened with Tristan yesterday
is our little secret, after all.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.630
What's going on?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.670
The spirits?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
Don't just jump out like that.
I haven't summoned you.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.680
Looks like they're trembling.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.140
Did something frighten them?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.690
Zarura N'Du?

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.230
"We are a Piece of the Great One"?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.900
Ring any bells?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.820
Well, how about this?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.120
Vas Zigra! "Awaken!"

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.540
Well?

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.040
What?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.540
No good?
Guess you've been out for too long.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.840
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.670
Hey. We're not done training yet.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.390
Level two, clear.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.930
Next up is level three.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.770
You just leave that with me again.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.940
Hey, wait!

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.450
Wow, pretty powerful.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.080
We're gonna have some fun with this one!

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.340
Don't tell me level three is...

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.470
Pellegarde?

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.390
Don't mind that Pellegarde.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.350
He's the one who awakened
Percival for us, after all.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.270
Damn, seriously?
Crossing swords at Pellegarde's level?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.410
I'm not falling for that again!

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.370
- Missed again!
- No!

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.710
That's a point!

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670
He won again.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.380
No way!

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.170
Still, that was only the Pellegarde
you calculated from Percival's memories.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.760
I doubt he's ever used
his full strength against Percival.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.890
At best, it was only half.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.890
And of course,
I'm not using my full reserves either.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.730
Level three, clear.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.770
Not half bad.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.900
Level four starts now.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.660
As much as I'd love to be all "Bring it!"

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.500
this is Percival's training, right?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.710
I won't butt in any more.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.670
I've had my fill of teasing you.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.550
Seems the one from this level is
the one Percival's gotta fight on his own.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.180
The one I have to fight on my own?

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.180
I know this presence! It's...

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.690
Ironside.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.730
He's going to fight Ironside
all on his own?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.150
Against someone
not even us four could take?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.700
I'm much stronger than I was back then.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.330
I must be on par with him now.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.460
Or at least pretty close...

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.710
Or I can give at least
a bit of a fight, maybe?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.210
Can I help him out one last time?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.390
Going back on your word already?

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.800
Absolutely no manners whatsoever.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.390
Have it your way.
Two versus one is fine by me.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.940
Don't get me wrong.
Percival's gonna do all the fighting.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.950
Wow.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.170
I feel the magic seeping into my body.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.920
My limbs... My fingers and toes...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.920
It's like I can feel through
every finger, every strand of hair!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.800
Every nerve in your body
has been heightened.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.890
Here he comes.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.940
Now it's my turn!

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.690
He can't dodge that!

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.530
I can't dodge an attack...

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.530
like that?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.370
Did you see that?

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.540
His timing was impeccable,
and that jump was superb.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.830
Was that you just now?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.460
I didn't do anything. That was all you.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.420
That was me?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.630
But you gotta learn
how to control your power.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.300
You'd be falling headfirst
if we were on a narrow edge.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:02.520
Do you see now just how much power
you've had untapped within you?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
Listen here.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.020
You need to learn and master
how every part of your body moves,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.820
at what timing,
and with how much strength.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.820
Why are you doing all this for me?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.660
It's simple.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.370
Because it is your duty...

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.250
to bring Ironside to justice.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.600
The miasma of death!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.020
Behemoth's negative energy
is closing in on us!

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.020
Seek shelter, quickly!

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.400
Hey, everyone! Look over there!

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.660
The rain of fire's stopped.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.670
The path to Behemoth is about to open.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.670
Master Percival
will save the Demon Realm again!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.670
Do not lose hope!

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.060
I'm afraid we must
count on you once again, Percival.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.190
Not sure I'll be much help,
but I'd like to try.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.190
Does this mean he passed his training?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.530
Nope. His opponent was too strong.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.160
- How about you, Donny?
- Don't even ask.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.200
Really?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.200
Come back to the Demon Realm anytime,
my bouncing baby boy.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.540
Gel.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.750
Gelda's right.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.630
You're not just the savior
of the Demon Realm.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.460
You're also like our beloved son.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.430
I've arranged transport
for you to get to Behemoth.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.300
Take care.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.980
Thank you.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.890
Percy. Let's go.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.600
Sure.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.330
It's moving! This thing is moving!

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.250
And it's ginormous.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.290
It's like a mountain!

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.250
And it's fast! This Alpion!

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.880
The Great Beasts, "Albion."

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.010
They're the golems used in the Holy War.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.760
Who'd have thought you could
climb inside and control them?

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.180
Hey! Why do you get to drive it?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.350
Whoo-hoo! I want a turn too!

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.730
You'll get your turn.
Let me handle it for now.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.520
Well, I'm glad everyone's having fun.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.530
But didn't they say we could set it
so it would take us there automatically?

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.410
Do you not have a man brain, Nasiens?

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.870
See? Lancelot gets it.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.120
A man brain?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.620
More like a kid's brain.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.130
Hey, you do realize
Gawain never came back, right?

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.420
She's right.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.010
Maybe we should have waited for her?

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.880
She's probably dead.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.390
Hey, that's no way to talk about a friend.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.060
There's no point
in worrying about that now.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.430
Our mission is simple.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.850
Find the door to Camelot and enter.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.190
And kill all who stand in our way.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.190
Gawain is a Knight of Prophecy.
She'll be back.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.280
That's just wishful thinking.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.320
You really think things work out
just like they do in stories?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.200
Chion. Stop it.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.200
Whatever happens,
we've got no choice in the matter.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.210
Because that is our destiny.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.710
Lancelot! Look out!

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.720
It's getting harder to see.
Behemoth must be close by.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.300
But hang on.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.680
Doesn't the miasma seem to be avoiding us?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.930
Maybe it's a feature of the Albion?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.240
Why does the miasma
have no effect on this area only?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.740
It matters not,
for it works out well for us.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.160
Not even I can protect us from the miasma.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.250
Either way,
we'll keep our presence hidden.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.130
Our goal is to destroy the door
and prevent them from entering.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.630
And to get rid of Percival.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.800
Our mission begins once we reach Behemoth.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.910
Hey, I wonder where Behemoth is?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.410
We've traveled pretty far.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.790
It's pretty big,
so we should be seeing it soon, I hope.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.670
No need to search.
We're already on Behemoth's back.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.680
What?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.430
You've been here before, you know?

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.720
Have I really, Jiggly-me?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.810
Don't call me that.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.190
Compared to Behemoth,
this Albion is the size of a flea.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.400
So we could find the door any moment now?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.450
But we'll never find it
with the miasma so thick.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.240
You noticed that too?

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.290
Seems we have some flies on our head.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.200
I'm gonna shake us.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.010
- Watch out, Tristan!
- Thank you.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.510
Looks like we've got company.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.310
How did they know?

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.980
I was sure our presence was hidden.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.690
They focused too much
on hiding their presence

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.860
and let their thoughts
leak out completely.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.490
There are six or seven of them.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.740
We are left with no choice.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.070
Arakdo! Destroy the Albion!

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.990
What is that?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.500
One of their purgatorial beasts.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.880
Not bad! A perfect match for the Albion!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.000
Why are you so happy about this?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.470
That thing's faster than the Albion.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.770
Doesn't this thing
have any anti-air defenses?

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.980
Fire! Shoot it down!

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.070
- Damn it.
- Zoa!

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.990
- It fired!
- Good job, Percy!

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.250
You keep firing at it.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.460
Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.170
Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.340
I think you overdid it!

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.710
What do I do?

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.340
Wow. This is so much fun.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.720
Lance! Back to reality!

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.050
What Tristan said!

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.310
How monstrously destructive!

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.980
I think we're done for, Sir Mortlach.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.030
It hit the Albion.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.490
We're not done for yet.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.990
Nice toy you got there.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.910
But it's no match for Arakdo,
the mystical beast from Purgatory.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.750
I sense their presence in its abdomen.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.880
Aim for the belly and--

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.930
No way.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.470
Stomach Ray.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.020
No enemy can survive
the Albion's killer move.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.180
That was just your bow and arrow!

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.690
But hot damn, what a bow and arrow!

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.190
What are you talking about?

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.530
That was the Albion's killer move.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.030
My mistake.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.860
Seems he can't stand the idea
of the Albion losing.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.030
I told you. Kid brain.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.450
Help, I'm scared.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.410
Hey, is someone trying to say something?

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.500
The Albion is falling.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.890
The Albion stopped moving.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.730
Are you sure it's okay to get out of it?

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.690
Yes, the miasma is still avoiding us.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.770
Wonder why it's doing that?

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.860
Is it you, Tristan?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.990
Not even the power of the Goddess Clan

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.820
can protect against
such powerful negative energy.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.990
Really?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.330
This is Percival's magic.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.290
This is my doing?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.080
No way.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.290
So this is why my uncle said
we'd be all right as long as he's with us.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.090
Who exactly are you?

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.510
Well, I don't really know either.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.550
I bet you know though, right?

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.560
Before we get to that,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.440
how about we take out
those dogs that have been sniffing around?

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:54.190
It was Percival
keeping the miasma at bay all along?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.280
Are you sure he's the weakest
of the Knights of Prophecy?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.780
I must say, we are severely disadvantaged.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.250
Saint Coat.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.540
SAINT COAT

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.540
Is that Goddess magic?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.170
Why would there be a Goddess
among the Knights of Chaos?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.340
The negative energy is too strong.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.430
We're in the heart of the miasma.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.010
Are we going to die?

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.930
We haven't even completed our mission.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.350
King Arthur, please forgive us.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.440
Don't give up!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.190
Looks like we have to roll the dice.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.200
Gawain!

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.290
So she fell into the hands of the enemy.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.120
We have brought shame to ourselves!

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.050
To think someone from the Goddess Clan
was walking among the humans.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.170
And he is incredibly skilled.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.970
What will you do,
O Knights of the Apocalypse?

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.890
Your precious friends will die
if you don't come on down here.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.360
Don't listen to him.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.320
It's my own fault
for charging ahead on my own.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.910
Stay right where you are
and bear witness to our deaths.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.330
I take full responsibility
for my own failure.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.330
My lady, you plan to go down with us?

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.870
You are mistaken, Mortlach.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.670
They are not my friends, nor my comrades.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.340
To them, I am just a stranger.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.930
Let's go!

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.680
Man, we always end up doing this!

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.060
- Percival!
- Tristan!

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.680
Why?

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.570
Looks like the gamble paid off.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.950
Why would you make things harder
for yourselves for a stranger like me?

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.330
You fools!

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.870
Everyone starts out as strangers at first.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.090
But you go through hardships together
and you end up becoming friends.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.840
Gawain. You're a good friend to us now.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.670
Please don't make my efforts

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.220
to convince you
to come along with us be in vain.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.970
I still owe you a pudding.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.230
You're so naive.
Each and every one of you.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.350
And you over there.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.320
I went to the trouble of saving you,
so I can't just watch you die.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.480
And you have something of mine to return.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.280
Percival?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.910
He saved you? Is this true?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.950
Explain yourself, Rosebank!

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.170
Percival, Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.460
You may be our enemy,
but you are an admirable young man.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.460
However...

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.470
We too have something we cannot concede.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.470
We too have something to protect.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.220
And for that,
we can let you go no further,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.230
even if it means resorting
to dishonorable means.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.310
Help...

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.230
There's that strange voice again.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.560
Help.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.860
Help us!

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440
Where am I?

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.200
Lancelot? Donny? Anne? Nasiens?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.490
Where is everyone?

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.660
Help us!

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.490
Go away, bad things. I'm scared.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.210
This is our world.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.620
Jiggly-me?

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.880
You were summoned by these voices.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.260
You were resonating with the voices,
and so you got pulled over to this side.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.470
Who's calling out to me?

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.140
Is it the same people
I've been hearing for a while now?

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.890
They're over there.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.470
Help us.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.140
- What's this blob?
- Bad things, go away!

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.860
It's afraid of the unusual events
taking place in the Demon Realm.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.280
This is the true form of
the gigantic beast they call "Behemoth."

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.700
This is Behemoth?

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.740
It is also our sibling.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.740
I don't understand.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.790
You mean to say you and me
are related to this thing?

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.670
Listen carefully.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.460
You and I, we have no form,
and we have no individual identity.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.050
We are beings who bring
prosperity and death to all the realms.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.970
What are you?

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.600
What am I?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.020
We are Life Spirits.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.400
Life Spirits?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.570
Yes.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.000
Humans, demons,
goddesses, giants, fairies.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.830
We are the source

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.670
that sustains all life in this world.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.380
That is what resides within Behemoth.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.960
That is what I am. And what you are.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.140
BANQUET FOR BRAVES

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.890
