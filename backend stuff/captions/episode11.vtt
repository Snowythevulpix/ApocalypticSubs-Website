WEBVTT

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.100
THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS:
FOUR KNIGHTS OF THE APOCALYPSE

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.440
THE BOY OF DESTINY

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.200
Did something happen with Tristan?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.870
He's been acting funny
ever since yesterday.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.030
Who knows.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.750
What happened with Tristan yesterday
is our little secret, after all.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.630
What's going on?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.670
The spirits?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.930
Don't just jump out like that.
I haven't summoned you.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.680
Looks like they're trembling.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.140
Did something frighten them?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.690
Zarura N'Du?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.230
"We are a Piece of the Great One"?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.900
Ring any bells?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820
Well, how about this?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.120
Vas Zigra! "Awaken!"

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.540
Well?

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.040
What?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.540
No good?
Guess you've been out for too long.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.840
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.670
Hey. We're not done training yet.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.390
Level two, clear.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.930
Next up is level three.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.770
You just leave that with me again.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.940
Hey, wait!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.450
Wow, pretty powerful.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.080
We're gonna have some fun with this one!

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.340
Don't tell me level three is...

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.470
Pellegarde?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.390
Don't mind that Pellegarde.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.350
He's the one who awakened
Percival for us, after all.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.270
Damn, seriously?
Crossing swords at Pellegarde's level?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.410
I'm not falling for that again!

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.370
- Missed again!
- No!

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.710
That's a point!

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.670
He won again.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.380
No way!

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.170
Still, that was only the Pellegarde
you calculated from Percival's memories.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.760
I doubt he's ever used
his full strength against Percival.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.890
At best, it was only half.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.890
And of course,
I'm not using my full reserves either.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.730
Level three, clear.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.770
Not half bad.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.900
Level four starts now.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.660
As much as I'd love to be all "Bring it!"

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.500
this is Percival's training, right?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.710
I won't butt in any more.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.670
I've had my fill of teasing you.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.550
Seems the one from this level is
the one Percival's gotta fight on his own.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.180
The one I have to fight on my own?

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.180
I know this presence! It's...

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.690
Ironside.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.730
He's going to fight Ironside
all on his own?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.150
Against someone
not even us four could take?

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm much stronger than I was back then.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.330
I must be on par with him now.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.460
Or at least pretty close...

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.710
Or I can give at least
a bit of a fight, maybe?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.210
Can I help him out one last time?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.390
Going back on your word already?

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.800
Absolutely no manners whatsoever.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.390
Have it your way.
Two versus one is fine by me.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.940
Don't get me wrong.
Percival's gonna do all the fighting.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.950
Wow.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.170
I feel the magic seeping into my body.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.920
My limbs... My fingers and toes...

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.920
It's like I can feel through
every finger, every strand of hair!

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.800
Every nerve in your body
has been heightened.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.890
Here he comes.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.940
Now it's my turn!

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.690
He can't dodge that!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.530
I can't dodge an attack...

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.530
like that?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.370
Did you see that?

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.540
His timing was impeccable,
and that jump was superb.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.830
Was that you just now?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.460
I didn't do anything. That was all you.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.420
That was me?

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.630
But you gotta learn
how to control your power.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.300
You'd be falling headfirst
if we were on a narrow edge.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:03.520
Do you see now just how much power
you've had untapped within you?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600
Listen here.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.020
You need to learn and master
how every part of your body moves,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.820
at what timing,
and with how much strength.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.820
Why are you doing all this for me?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.660
It's simple.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.370
Because it is your duty...

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.250
to bring Ironside to justice.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.600
The miasma of death!

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.020
Behemoth's negative energy
is closing in on us!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.020
Seek shelter, quickly!

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.400
Hey, everyone! Look over there!

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.660
The rain of fire's stopped.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.670
The path to Behemoth is about to open.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.670
Master Percival
will save the Demon Realm again!

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.670
Do not lose hope!

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.060
I'm afraid we must
count on you once again, Percival.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.190
Not sure I'll be much help,
but I'd like to try.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.190
Does this mean he passed his training?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.530
Nope. His opponent was too strong.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.160
- How about you, Donny?
- Don't even ask.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.200
Really?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.200
Come back to the Demon Realm anytime,
my bouncing baby boy.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.540
Gel.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.750
Gelda's right.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.630
You're not just the savior
of the Demon Realm.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.460
You're also like our beloved son.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.430
I've arranged transport
for you to get to Behemoth.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.300
Take care.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:06.980
Thank you.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.890
Percy. Let's go.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.600
Sure.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.330
It's moving! This thing is moving!

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.250
And it's ginormous.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.290
It's like a mountain!

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.250
And it's fast! This Alpion!

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.880
The Great Beasts, "Albion."

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.010
They're the golems used in the Holy War.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.760
Who'd have thought you could
climb inside and control them?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.180
Hey! Why do you get to drive it?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.350
Whoo-hoo! I want a turn too!

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.730
You'll get your turn.
Let me handle it for now.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.520
Well, I'm glad everyone's having fun.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.530
But didn't they say we could set it
so it would take us there automatically?

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.410
Do you not have a man brain, Nasiens?

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.870
See? Lancelot gets it.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.120
A man brain?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.620
More like a kid's brain.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.130
Hey, you do realize
Gawain never came back, right?

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.420
She's right.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.010
Maybe we should have waited for her?

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.880
She's probably dead.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.390
Hey, that's no way to talk about a friend.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.060
There's no point
in worrying about that now.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.430
Our mission is simple.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.850
Find the door to Camelot and enter.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.190
And kill all who stand in our way.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.190
Gawain is a Knight of Prophecy.
She'll be back.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.280
That's just wishful thinking.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.320
You really think things work out
just like they do in stories?

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.200
Chion. Stop it.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.200
Whatever happens,
we've got no choice in the matter.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.210
Because that is our destiny.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.710
Lancelot! Look out!

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.720
It's getting harder to see.
Behemoth must be close by.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.300
But hang on.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.680
Doesn't the miasma seem to be avoiding us?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.930
Maybe it's a feature of the Albion?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.240
Why does the miasma
have no effect on this area only?

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.740
It matters not,
for it works out well for us.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.160
Not even I can protect us from the miasma.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.250
Either way,
we'll keep our presence hidden.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.130
Our goal is to destroy the door
and prevent them from entering.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.630
And to get rid of Percival.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.800
Our mission begins once we reach Behemoth.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.910
Hey, I wonder where Behemoth is?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.410
We've traveled pretty far.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.790
It's pretty big,
so we should be seeing it soon, I hope.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.670
No need to search.
We're already on Behemoth's back.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.680
What?

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.430
You've been here before, you know?

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.720
Have I really, Jiggly-me?

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.810
Don't call me that.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.190
Compared to Behemoth,
this Albion is the size of a flea.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.400
So we could find the door any moment now?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.450
But we'll never find it
with the miasma so thick.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.240
You noticed that too?

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.290
Seems we have some flies on our head.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.200
I'm gonna shake us.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.010
- Watch out, Tristan!
- Thank you.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.510
Looks like we've got company.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.310
How did they know?

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.980
I was sure our presence was hidden.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.690
They focused too much
on hiding their presence

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.860
and let their thoughts
leak out completely.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.490
There are six or seven of them.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.740
We are left with no choice.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.070
Arakdo! Destroy the Albion!

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.990
What is that?

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.500
One of their purgatorial beasts.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.880
Not bad! A perfect match for the Albion!

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.000
Why are you so happy about this?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.470
That thing's faster than the Albion.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.770
Doesn't this thing
have any anti-air defenses?

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.980
Fire! Shoot it down!

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.070
- Damn it.
- Zoa!

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.990
- It fired!
- Good job, Percy!

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.250
You keep firing at it.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.460
Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.170
Zoa, Zoa, Zoa, Zoa!

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.340
I think you overdid it!

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.710
What do I do?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.340
Wow. This is so much fun.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.720
Lance! Back to reality!

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.050
What Tristan said!

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.310
How monstrously destructive!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.980
I think we're done for, Sir Mortlach.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.030
It hit the Albion.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.490
We're not done for yet.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.990
Nice toy you got there.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.910
But it's no match for Arakdo,
the mystical beast from Purgatory.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.750
I sense their presence in its abdomen.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.880
Aim for the belly and--

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.930
No way.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.470
Stomach Ray.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.020
No enemy can survive
the Albion's killer move.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.180
That was just your bow and arrow!

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.690
But hot damn, what a bow and arrow!

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.190
What are you talking about?

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.530
That was the Albion's killer move.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.030
My mistake.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.860
Seems he can't stand the idea
of the Albion losing.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.030
I told you. Kid brain.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.450
Help, I'm scared.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.410
Hey, is someone trying to say something?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.500
The Albion is falling.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.890
The Albion stopped moving.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.730
Are you sure it's okay to get out of it?

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.690
Yes, the miasma is still avoiding us.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.770
Wonder why it's doing that?

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.860
Is it you, Tristan?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.990
Not even the power of the Goddess Clan

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.820
can protect against
such powerful negative energy.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.990
Really?

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.330
This is Percival's magic.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.290
This is my doing?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.080
No way.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.290
So this is why my uncle said
we'd be all right as long as he's with us.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.090
Who exactly are you?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.510
Well, I don't really know either.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.550
I bet you know though, right?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.560
Before we get to that,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.440
how about we take out
those dogs that have been sniffing around?

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:55.190
It was Percival
keeping the miasma at bay all along?

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.280
Are you sure he's the weakest
of the Knights of Prophecy?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.780
I must say, we are severely disadvantaged.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.250
Saint Coat.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.540
SAINT COAT

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.540
Is that Goddess magic?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.170
Why would there be a Goddess
among the Knights of Chaos?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.340
The negative energy is too strong.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.430
We're in the heart of the miasma.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.010
Are we going to die?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.930
We haven't even completed our mission.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.350
King Arthur, please forgive us.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.440
Don't give up!

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.190
Looks like we have to roll the dice.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.200
Gawain!

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.290
So she fell into the hands of the enemy.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.120
We have brought shame to ourselves!

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.050
To think someone from the Goddess Clan
was walking among the humans.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.170
And he is incredibly skilled.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.970
What will you do,
O Knights of the Apocalypse?

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.890
Your precious friends will die
if you don't come on down here.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.360
Don't listen to him.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.320
It's my own fault
for charging ahead on my own.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.910
Stay right where you are
and bear witness to our deaths.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.330
I take full responsibility
for my own failure.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.330
My lady, you plan to go down with us?

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.870
You are mistaken, Mortlach.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.670
They are not my friends, nor my comrades.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.340
To them, I am just a stranger.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.930
Let's go!

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.680
Man, we always end up doing this!

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.060
- Percival!
- Tristan!

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.680
Why?

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.570
Looks like the gamble paid off.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.950
Why would you make things harder
for yourselves for a stranger like me?

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.330
You fools!

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.870
Everyone starts out as strangers at first.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.090
But you go through hardships together
and you end up becoming friends.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.840
Gawain. You're a good friend to us now.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.670
Please don't make my efforts

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.220
to convince you
to come along with us be in vain.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.970
I still owe you a pudding.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.230
You're so naive.
Each and every one of you.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.350
And you over there.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.320
I went to the trouble of saving you,
so I can't just watch you die.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.480
And you have something of mine to return.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.280
Percival?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.910
He saved you? Is this true?

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.950
Explain yourself, Rosebank!

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.170
Percival, Knight of the Apocalypse.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.460
You may be our enemy,
but you are an admirable young man.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.460
However...

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.470
We too have something we cannot concede.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.470
We too have something to protect.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.220
And for that,
we can let you go no further,

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.230
even if it means resorting
to dishonorable means.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.310
Help...

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.230
There's that strange voice again.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.560
Help.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.860
Help us!

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440
Where am I?

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.200
Lancelot? Donny? Anne? Nasiens?

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.490
Where is everyone?

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.660
Help us!

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.490
Go away, bad things. I'm scared.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.210
This is our world.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.620
Jiggly-me?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.880
You were summoned by these voices.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.260
You were resonating with the voices,
and so you got pulled over to this side.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.470
Who's calling out to me?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.140
Is it the same people
I've been hearing for a while now?

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.890
They're over there.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.470
Help us.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.140
- What's this blob?
- Bad things, go away!

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.860
It's afraid of the unusual events
taking place in the Demon Realm.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.280
This is the true form of
the gigantic beast they call "Behemoth."

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.700
This is Behemoth?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.740
It is also our sibling.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.740
I don't understand.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.790
You mean to say you and me
are related to this thing?

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.670
Listen carefully.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.460
You and I, we have no form,
and we have no individual identity.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.050
We are beings who bring
prosperity and death to all the realms.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.970
What are you?

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.600
What am I?

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.020
We are Life Spirits.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.400
Life Spirits?

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.570
Yes.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.000
Humans, demons,
goddesses, giants, fairies.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.830
We are the source

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.670
that sustains all life in this world.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.380
That is what resides within Behemoth.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.960
That is what I am. And what you are.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.140
BANQUET FOR BRAVES

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.890
